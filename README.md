# Linear-Regression
My first linear regression project that I've completed. It's not perfect by any means and has a lot of rough edges to it but it's being uploaded here as a starting point

A very simple multiple regression based off the Korean Real Estate dataset on Kaggle.

# Problem Statement: Finding out the SalePrice of a house.

# Language and Libraries Used: Python, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matpltlib, Pandas, Numpy


# What I Learned:

1. The Linear Regression Workflow - Dataset Exploration, Exploratory Data Analyis, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building

2. The appropriate graphs to use for converying information to the individual/client that is concerned
